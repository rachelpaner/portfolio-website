			<h3>Background</h3> 
			 <p> I joined Develop for Good, an organization that gives student designers and engineers an opportunity to create tech solutions for social good. Our team was paired with Roc Solid Foundation, a non-profit that builds hope for children and families fighting cancer through the power of play, founded in 2009 by pediatric cancer survivor Eric Newman.  </p>


			<h3>The Challenge</h3>

        </div>

            <p class='callout'> The average treatment cycle for a child with cancer is 3 years, or <span class="reveal" id="days"> 1095 days. </span></p> <br>
            
        <div class="project-body">

			<p>Roc Solid Foundation currently offers two forms of support through <b>Ready Bags</b> given at at the beginning of the child's journey, and <b>playsets</b> built during treatment, which provide a safe place to play for children with immunocompromised systems. </p> 

            <p> Though these two initiatives have made a significant impact in the lives of families fighting cancer, Roc Solid Foundation wants to fill in the areas of the 1095 day cycle that their current programs cannot support:<i> everything in-between.</i> </p>

			<h3>Prototyping</h3>

			<ol type="I">
				<li class="subsection">Ideation and Lo-Fidelity Prototypes</li>
				<p>With a clear goal in mind, we started by brainstorming our primary features and mapping out the complex information architecture of the app. By establishing the flow of the app, we were able to create our lo-fi prototypes and start to visualize the functionality and interactions of each feature.</p>
                <img class="center img-fluid reg-image" src="../images/1095/1095-ia.png" alt="FigJam Information Architecture Map">

                <li class="subsection">Design System</li>
				<p>We went back and forth with our client regarding the color scheme, as they originally wanted to use muted grey and greens to represent balance and serenity.</p> 
                
                <p>However, we suggested a more vibrant color scheme, and after validating our choice with users, our final design system uses blue as a primary color for its calming connotation and alignment with Roc Solid’s current brand colors, and pairs it with bright secondary colors to represent hope, energy, and strength. </p>

				<img class="center img-fluid reg-image" src="../images/1095/1095-design-system.png" alt="Wireframes created on Figma">

				<li class="subsection">Usability Testing</li>
				<p>Through each iteration of our prototypes, we went through multiple revisions and meetings with Roc Solid Foundation to properly incorporate their feedback into our design process. In order to collect user feedback and identify any opportunities for improvement, we conducted usability testing with <b>18 users.</b>     
                <p>I took responsibility for all data organization and analysis, and I sorted user task performance and responses into actionable insights through <b>affinity mapping</b>. </p>

                <h3>Results</h3>

                <p>After creating our hi-fi deliverables, <b>4/4</b> of our las round of tested users, real parents from Roc Solid Foundation, reacted positively to the app and found it to be impactful, simple, and user-friendly.

                Our client was extremely happy with the final product, and we have completed the development hand-off. Our team is currently plays a role of design consultants as Roc Solid prepares for next steps with our prototype.</p>
