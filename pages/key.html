			<h3>Background</h3> 
			 <p> I spent the summer as an intern at the Key Design Studio, which is an embedded change agency that aims to transform the historical KeyBank through design thinking. Part of this mission includes developing and deploying a design system to maximize consistency and efficiency across the company's 20+ different product teams, which has reached barriers related to resource allocation and convincing upper-level stakeholders of its business value. 
                <br><br>
              Together, the 2 other studio interns and myself took ownership of a capstone project to dive deeper into these issues and propose recommendations to scale the design system across the enterprise. </p>

        

			<h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p> Product development teams across the company inconsistently adopted the design system because of a <b>lack of compatibility </b> with the products' different user needs and existing frameworks and an <b>unclear value propostition for adoption</b>.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the current design system team consisted of 10 designers and just 2 developers working on a <b>voluntary basis
            </b> outside of their higher-priority projects, leading to resource and time constraints that dampened <b>cross-collaboration, regular system updates, and organization of materials</b>.

            <br><br>
            These issues in and outside of the studio resulted in <b>unproductive internal workflows </b>and an <b>incoherent design vision</b> within the the company.

			<h3>Research</h3>
			<ol type="I">
				<li class="subsection">Current State Product Landscape</li>
				<p>We surveyed stakeholders for over 20 different products to get a better idea of how the design system is currently used. We found that almost half of the products did not reference the design system at all, reflecting a significant inconsistency across workflows and user experience.
                    <img class="reveal enter img-fluid reg-image" src="../images/key/key_current_state.png" alt="Current State Product Landscape breakdown">


                <li class="subsection">Stakeholder Interviews</li>
				<p>In order to expand on this snapshot of the product landscape and gain a holistic view of the varying perspectives on the design system, we interviewed 20 different stakeholders across the enterprise, including in-studio designers, developers, product owners, marketing, and several industry competitors, such as Capital One and Intuit.

                            <p class="insight-des"> Outside of the studio, many stakeholders view the design system as an unnecessary change to their workflow, and the extra time, manpower, and financial resources needed to implement the system is not adequately justified by the perceived benefits. 
                            </li></p>
                       
                        <li class="reveal list-insight" id="first"><span class="highlight-purple">Communication and consistency is difficult across a large enterprise</span>
                            <p class="insight-des">Each product team has different needs and processes that are largely unknown to those outside of a single team. Factors such as varying product timelines, internal competition, and distinct lines of business causes inconsistent workflow and user experience across products and prevents a steady cadence between different stakeholder groups.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li class="reveal list-insight" id="first"><span class="highlight-purple"> There is no attachment to clear business goals and design values.</span>

                              The design system's lack of a clear vision affects its perceived business value. The design system has resulted in more efficient prioritization, and more consistent user experience across products, but these successes have not been effectively framed in a digestible, organized way that resonates across the entire enterprise.

            <h3>Testing and Outcomes</h3>
            <p> Our process culminated in a presentation to our studio stakeholders, paired with an Assumption-Reversal workshop. Through this exercise, we were able to get the design team to directly apply the information that they had learned to their own experiences with the design system, as well as simulate a vision alignment workshop on a smaller scale before expanding it to non-design stakeholders.</p>

                <p>Overall, our roadmap gained an overwhelmingly positive response from the studio, with team members expressing both that they resonated with our points, and learned about new pain points and constraints from non-design perspective that they had not previously considered. Aligning with our "Now" recommendations, the roadmap itself will be a critical tool in future conversations with leadership to increase top-down buy-in, advocating for the design system's value in a company that is historically rooted in legacy systems and bottom lines. </p>
            
				
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>

                <div class="reveal insight "> <span class="highlight-purple">
                    Design strategy in practice</span> 
                </div>
                <p>This project helped me understand the applications of end-to-end human-centered design process outside of a singular product context, and how to utilitze research and design thinking tools to navigate abstract deliverables </p>
    
                <div class="reveal insight "> <span class="highlight-purple">
                    The importance of empathy within enterprise </span> 
                </div>
                <p>We interviewed a diverse set of stakeholders with varying perspectives of the design system, both positive and negative. Thus, it was extremely important for us to establish a tone of psychological safety with our interviewees and express our that we were there to learn from them, not push the design system onto them.</p>
                <div class="reveal insight "> <span class="highlight-purple">
                    Leverage all available resources  </span> 
                </div>
                <p>With so many research initiatives and stakeholders, we took every opportunity to reach out to colleagues for points of contact for interviews, access to reosurces such as Forrester Reports, expert references such as the Figma team, and design thinking tools to organize and synthesize our findings.</p>
