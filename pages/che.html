			<h3>Background</h3> 
			 <p> 
                The Che Café is a historic social "DIY Space" and iconic music venue at UCSD, established in 1980 as an autonomous and volunteer-run space dedicated to promoting radical politics, music, culture and community engagement.
                <br><br>
                The Che Café has faced challenges over the years, including financial difficulties and threats of eviction, but its dedicated community of volunteers and concert-goers have worked tirelessly to keep the space alive and continue its mission of providing a platform for activism, art, and social change.</p>


			<h3>The Challenge</h3>

        </div>

            <p class='callout'>The current Che Café website's <b>lack of information hierarchy</b>, <b>lack of personal branding and images</b>, and <b>poor navigation</b> leads to an inffective site that fails to communicate the unique history and mission of the Che to potential patrons.</p> <br>

			<h3>Prototyping</h3>

			<ol type="I">
				<li class="subsection">Ideation and Wireframes</li>
				<p>Combining the existing website with our priority list, we mapped out the new site architecture to help guide navigation and our design decisions. One particular challenge was condensing the original <b>13 tabs</b> into <b>7 tabs </b>with corresponding sub-categories. We put this site achitecture into practice by creating wireframes, utilizing a <b>mobile-first</b> approach. </p>

				<img class="center img-fluid reg-image" src="../images/che/che_wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes created on Figma">

                <li class="subsection">Moodboard</li>
				<p>We went back and forth with our client regarding the color scheme, as they originally wanted to use muted grey and greens to represent balance and serenity.</p> 
                
                <p>However, we suggested a more vibrant color scheme, and after validating our choice with users, our final design system uses blue as a primary color for its calming connotation and alignment with Roc Solid’s current brand colors, and pairs it with bright secondary colors to represent hope, energy, and strength. </p>

				<img class="center img-fluid reg-image" src="../images/1095/1095-design-system.png" alt="Wireframes created on Figma">

				<li class="subsection">Usability Testing</li>
				<p>As we developed our wireframes into lo-fi prototypes, we met consistently with our client to make sure that we were on the same page. As we transitioned towards hi-fi prototypes, we went beyond our client perspective and conducted usability testing with <b> 4 users</b> to identify any blindspots or room for improvement.

                <h3>Results</h3>

                <p>After creating our hi-fi deliverables, <b>4/4</b> of our last round of tested users, real parents from Roc Solid Foundation, reacted positively to the app and found it to be impactful, simple, and user-friendly.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Our client was extremely happy with the final product, and we have completed the development hand-off. Our team currently plays a role of design consultants as Roc Solid prepares for next steps with our prototype.</p>
				
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>

                <div class="reveal insight "> <span class="highlight-yellow">
                    Communication and clarity lead to client satisfaction</span> 
                </div>
                <p>During the early phases of the project, we hit some roadblocks due to multiple levels of miscommunication on the timeline and scope of deliverables. Being transparent with the client about feasibility, working through solutions together, and involving them in every step of the design process creates a connection a deeper level and helped set clear expectations. </p>
    
                <div class="reveal insight "> <span class="highlight-yellow">
                    How to practice empathy on a nuanced level</span> 
                </div>
                <p>Working with such an intense subject as pediatric cancer and the diversity of those it affects has helped me understand the utmost importance of examining users through an empathetic lens. Seemingly minute details can make all the difference in a user's experience, and it is crucial to approach a contextual situation from all angles.</p>
